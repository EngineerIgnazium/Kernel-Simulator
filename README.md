# |---+-> Kernel Simulator <-+---|

The build is currently [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/9anm0jc0x9raoy8x/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/EoflaOE/kernel-simulator/branch/master)

This kernel simulator simulates our **future** kernel that is planned by us and is not a final planned version of Kernel, since it was minimal. Cannot log-in to Kernel Simulator on **root** account? The password is the _backwards_ of **root**.

## |-----+--> _Notes_ <--+-----|

- This kernel simulator _will_ continue to be developed, even if we made the real PC version of Kernel.

- It can only be Console at the moment, while we are developing a GUI for this simulator.

- The version of Firefox was old and so we cannot upload binary into release page. You have to build from source to use, or use an archive, Because the machine that we're developing and building on doesn't have SSE2 support on our build CPU, **AMD Athlon XP 1500+**. To download, use above link.

## |-----+--> _Prerequisites_ <--+-----|

- Windows XP or higher (Kernel Simulator is planned to use .NET Framework 4.7 or higher to optimize usage for Windows 10 systems, etc.)

- [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0](https://download.microsoft.com/download/1/B/E/1BE39E79-7E39-46A3-96FF-047F95396215/dotNetFx40_Full_setup.exe) or higher is **important and required** for Kernel Simulator to work fully. If you have Windows 8 or later, you might already have this version of Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0.

- MadMilkman DLL or installed library (DLL tested)
