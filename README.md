# |---+-> Kernel Simulator <-+---|

The build is currently [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/9anm0jc0x9raoy8x/branch/master?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/EoflaOE/kernel-simulator/branch/master)

INFO: This kernel simulator simulates our **future** kernel that is planned by us.

NOTE: This kernel simulator _will_ continue to be developed, even if we made the real PC version of Kernel.

INFO: This kernel simulator is not a final planned version of Kernel, since it was minimal.

NOTE: It can only be Console at the moment, while we are developing a GUI for this simulator.

Kernel Simulator lets you simulate a _very_ early access for our **future** Kernel. It provides the built-in hardware
detector, log-in manager, and the shell.

Cannot log-in to Kernel Simulator on **root** account? The password is the _backwards_ of **root**.
