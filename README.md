# |---+-> Kernel Simulator <-+---|

INFO: This kernel simulator simulates our **future** kernel that is planned by us.

NOTE: This kernel simulator _will_ continue to be developed, even if we made the real PC version of Kernel.

INFO: This kernel simulator is not a final planned version of Kernel, since it was minimal.

NOTE: It can only be Console at the moment, while we are developing a GUI for this simulator.

Kernel Simulator lets you simulate a _very_ early access for our **future** Kernel. It provides the built-in hardware
detector, log-in manager (Just adduser), and the shell.
